\chapter{Programming practicals}
\label{ch:programming}

In this Chapter you will process some real geochronological datasets
using \texttt{R}. \texttt{R} is a free and open programming language
that works on any operating system, including \texttt{Windows},
\texttt{OS-X} and \texttt{Unix/Linux}. It can be downloaded and
installed from \texttt{http://r-project.org}. Section~\ref{sec:R}
presents a brief \texttt{R} tutorial, which covers most commands that
you will need for the subsequent computer practicals.
