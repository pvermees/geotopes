\chapter{\texttt{json} schema}\label{ch:schema}

All the data and settings that are used by the GUI can be saved in a
human-readable text file, using the \texttt{.json} database format.
This format provides a useful method to archive \texttt{IsoplotR} data
for those users who do not want to use the CLI. The \texttt{.json}
format can also be used as a data exchange mechanism between
\texttt{IsoplotR} and other data processing software. If this software
produces a file that follows the following schema, then its output can
be used as input to \texttt{IsoplotR} for further processing.  The
\texttt{.json} format has a nested structure, which is summerised
below from the top downwards. At the highest level, the \texttt{.json}
data structure consists of four branches:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\tt "constants"}: Lists the decay constants, isotopic ratios,
  molar masses, and various fission track properties.
\item{\tt "settings"}: Contains \texttt{IsoplotR}'s language
  settings and parameters controlling the behaviour of the various
  geochronometers and plot devices.
\item{\tt "data"}: Stores the contents of the GUI's input window,
  i.e. all the isotopic ratio data and calibration constants.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\texttt{"constants"} contains of the following items:

will remain empty. However if both the U--Pb and Ar--Ar data have
changed, say, then both of these attributes will be filled.
