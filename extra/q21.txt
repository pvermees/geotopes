Suppose that the Ar-Ar age of question 19 and the fission track age of
question 20 were measured on the same sample of gneiss. Further
suppose that this sample was also dated with the U-Th-He method on
apatite, resulting in an age of 45 $\pm$ 5 Ma. Assess the significance
of this estimate and interpret the geological history of the sample.

   \underline{Answer}:

   The U-Th-He age is slightly younger than the Ar-Ar and fission track
   ages, but falls within their analytical uncertainty. Therefore, the
   three ages are statistical indistinguishable.  The Ar-Ar, fission
   track and U-Th-He methods are thermochronometers with different
   closure temperatures. The fact that they all give the same age
   indicates that the gneiss cooled rapidly, likely indicating rapid
   exhumation by combined tectonic uplift and erosion.
