This document contains additional exercises that are to be completed
during the live sessions on Mondays and Tuesdays. Some of these are
advanced exercises that require creative thinking. Completing these
exercises will deepen your understanding of the taught material.  They
illustrate how the tools provided in the notes can be generalised to
other chronometers, which we lack the time to discuss in
detail. Practical exercises 3 and 4 in Part 2 of this document are
quite involved.  Do not be afraid to ask for additional tips or hints
if you get stuck. I will be happy to share the solution to all the
questions with you, but only after you give them a try yourself.
