This document contains additional exercises that are to be completed
during the live sessions on Mondays and Tuesdays. Some of these are
advanced exercises that require creative thinking. You can use the
notes and cheat sheet to answer them. Completing these exercises will
deepen your understanding of the taught material.  They illustrate how
the tools provided in the notes can be generalised to other
chronometers, which we lack the time to discuss in detail. Practical
exercises 3 and 4 in Part 2 of this document are quite involved.  Do
not be afraid to ask for additional tips or hints if you get
stuck. You can download the model answer by uploading your own
